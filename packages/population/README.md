# threejs-population

Signs of life for procedural worlds: population density on a hexagonal hierarchical grid
([H3](https://h3geo.org)), with urban centres, towns, villages, hamlets and farmsteads placed as central places, sized
by rank, and joined by roads, railways and power lines that follow the terrain. It reads a
[`threejs-biomes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/threejs-biomes) `World`, flat or planet. Generation is seeded and
procedural: it looks random, but the same world and options always give the same people.

```bash
npm i threejs-population threejs-biomes three
```

## three.js

```ts
import { World } from 'threejs-biomes'
import { Population, PopulationOverlay, renderPopulationMap } from 'threejs-population'

const world = new World({ seed: 'valley' })
const population = new Population(world, { totalPopulation: 1_500_000, radius: 24_000, cellSize: 500 })

population.data.settlements[0]        // { id: 0, class: 'city', population: 222381, position: [x, z], radius: 4207, … }
population.data.cells                 // per H3 cell: population, density, landUse, light, habitability, …
population.network.edges              // highway / road / track / rail / powerline polylines in [x, z]
population.set({ zipf: 1.2 })         // live: regenerates, the overlay rebuilds

const overlay = new PopulationOverlay({ population, camera, mode: 'density', extrude: 600 })
scene.add(overlay.object)
renderer.setAnimationLoop(() => { overlay.update(); renderer.render(scene, camera) })

const pixels = renderPopulationMap(population.data, { mode: 'landUse', resolution: 256 }, population.network)
ctx.putImageData(new ImageData(pixels, 256), 0, 0) // pure RGBA, also in workers and tests
```

Everything under `Population` is also a pure function: `generatePopulation(world, options)`,
`generateNetworks(data)`, `aggregatePopulation(data, res)`, `nightLights(data, res)`.

## React Three Fiber

```tsx
import { useWorld, WorldTerrain } from 'threejs-biomes/react'
import { PopulationOverlay, usePopulation } from 'threejs-population/react'

function Scene() {
  const world = useWorld({ seed: 'valley' })
  const population = usePopulation(world, { totalPopulation: 900_000 })
  return (
    <>
      <WorldTerrain world={world} />
      <PopulationOverlay population={population} mode="lights" extrude={0} opacity={0.8} />
    </>
  )
}
```

`usePopulation` returns a `Population` that follows its options by value. `<PopulationOverlay>` props are the overlay
options; removing a prop reverts it. React is an optional peer dependency; the core never imports it.

## Why hexagons

Every cell of a hexagonal grid has six neighbours at the same distance, all sharing an edge. Squares have two kinds of
neighbour (edge and corner) and favour the grid axes. So hexagons give:

- **Uniform cells:** one size and shape, so counts compare directly and density is just count / area.
- **Smoothing:** aggregating into hexagons evens out local noise without the blocky, axis-aligned look of squares.
- **Less directional bias:** distance in rings is close to real distance in every direction, so market areas,
  distance decay and routing look natural.
- **Hierarchy:** H3 nests resolutions (each about 7× the area of the next finer one), so the same data can be shown at
  400 m, 3 km or 22 km cells. Coarser cells are exact sums of their children.

Central-place theory ends up with hexagons too. Christaller's market areas are hexagonal, and his K = 7
"administrative" system nests 7 areas in each larger one, the same aperture as H3. So the tiers here are urban centres,
towns, villages and hamlets, one H3 resolution apart.

## How it works

1. **Habitability** per fine cell from the `World`: zero on water and where avoided biomes dominate (deep ocean, glacier,
   peaks, volcanic). Elsewhere it is the product of biome fertility, gentle slope (from three samples), comfortable
   temperature, and fresh water (river valleys) or a coast nearby.
2. **Central places:** at each tier's resolution, cells whose mean habitability (with seeded jitter) is a local maximum
   become settlements. Each higher-tier place closes its own cell and ring to lower tiers (its market area). Each
   settlement sits on the best fine cell inside, at a seeded spot that is always dry land.
3. **Rank-size:** settlements sorted by tier, then score, get P₁ / r^`zipf` people, with P₁ set so they sum to
   (1 − `ruralShare`) × `totalPopulation`. The class (metropolis … hamlet) comes from `thresholds`.
4. **Spreading:** a settlement's people spread over nearby cells with a Gaussian of its radius
   (√(P / π·`urbanDensity`)), so density decays from centres. Rural people spread over habitable land, more along rivers
   and coasts (`corridor`) and near settlements (`ruralDecay`). Cell counts are integers summing to the total.
5. **Land use:** `urban` / `suburban` by density, `farmland` by habitability, else `wilderness`, plus `water`. Farmland
   cells may get a farmstead.
6. **Networks:** a minimum spanning tree over all settlements (every one is reachable by road), plus gravity-model links
   (P₁·P₂ / dᵏ) where the tree forces a detour. Each link is an A* route over the hex graph, costed by slope² and water,
   and cheaper on cells earlier routes use so roads merge into trunks. Highways route first. Rail repeats the plan for
   big places with a stiffer slope cost. Power lines are straight spans along a spanning tree.

## H3 on any world

| World | Mapping | Cell size |
|---|---|---|
| Planet | direction → latitude `asin(y/|p|)`, longitude `atan2(x, z)` (as `World.frameAt`) | H3's size × radius / 6 371 007 m |
| Flat | equirectangular on an Earth-sized globe: lat = −z / R⊕, lng = −40.5° + x / R⊕ | H3's published sizes (res 8 ≈ 531 m edge, 0.74 km²) |

The flat anchor (0°, −40.5°) is the point on the equator farthest (3900 km) from H3's 12 pentagons, so flat worlds only
see hexagons. Within ±2000 km of the origin, cells are within 5 % of their nominal size. On a 120 km planet, res 8
cells are 10 m across and res 3 cells are 1.3 km. `cellSize` (metres) picks the nearest resolution for the world
either way. `HexGrid` exposes the mapping: `cellAt` / `cellAtLocal`, `center` / `centerLocal`, `boundaryLocal`,
`area`, `disk` (k-ring), `parent`, `children`, `edgeLength`, `resolutionFor(metres)`, `toLatLng` / `fromLatLng`.

## Data for other packages

| Type | Fields |
|---|---|
| `Settlement` | `id`, `cell`, `position: [x, z]`, `population`, `class` (`metropolis`…`farmstead`), `radius` (m), `level` (tier), `rank` |
| `PopulationCell` | `cell`, `position`, `elevation`, `slope`, `area` (m²), `habitability`, `water`, `population`, `density` (/km²), `landUse`, `light` |
| `PopulationData` | `cells`, `index` (cell → i), `neighbours` (hex graph), `settlements`, `resolution`, `cellEdge`, `grid`, `total` |
| `NetworkEdge` | `type` (`highway` / `road` / `track` / `rail` / `powerline`), `from` / `to` (settlement ids), `points: [x, z][]`, `cells`, `length` |
| `NightLightField` | typed arrays `centers` (xyz), `local` (xz), `intensity`, `population`, plus `sample(x, y, z)` / `sampleLocal(x, z)` |

Positions are local `[x, z]` metres in the population's `LocalFrame` (the world itself on flat worlds).

## Options

`PopulationOptions` (plain JSON; `set` merges, `reset` replaces):

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `seed` | `1` | Seed for jitter, hamlet and farmstead choices and positions. |

| `center`, `radius` | `[0, 0]`, `24000` | The populated disk, local metres. |
| `cellSize` | `500` | Target fine-cell edge, metres (picks the H3 resolution). |
| `totalPopulation` | `1500000` | People in the region. |
| `ruralShare` | `0.15` | Share living outside ranked settlements. |
| `zipf` | `1` | Rank-size exponent. |
| `levels` | `4` | Tiers: centres, towns, villages, hamlets. |
| `jitter` | `0.35` | Seeded score jitter, so the lattice looks natural. |
| `minHabitability` | `0.12` | Site score a settlement needs. |
| `hamletChance`, `farmsteadChance` | `0.6`, `0.5` | Thinning of hamlets and farmsteads. |

| `lightDensity` | `1500` | Density at which night lights reach 63 %. |
| `habitability` | see source | `avoid` biomes, `fertility` per biome, `maxSlope`, `temperature`, `temperatureRange`, `water`. |
| `network` | see source | `extraEdges`, `gravityExponent`, `detour`, `slopeCost`, `railSlopeCost`, `waterCost`, `reuse`, `highwayPopulation`, `roadPopulation`, `railPopulation`, `powerlinePopulation`, `smoothing`. |

`OverlayOptions`:

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `'density'` | `density`, `landUse`, `lights` or `habitability`. |
| `resolution` | `'auto'` | H3 resolution, or step coarser as the camera pulls away. |
| `coarsest`, `autoDistance` | `3`, `40` | Auto: up to 3 levels coarser; switch after 40 fine-cell edges of distance. |
| `extrude` | `400` | Prism height at the top of the ramp, metres (0 = flat tiles). |
| `offset`, `gap`, `opacity` | `4`, `0.06`, `0.6` | Lift, gap between cells, opacity. |
| `networks`, `networkOffset` | `true`, `3` | Draw networks as lines. |
| `origin` | `[0, 0, 0]` | Floating origin, as in `WorldTerrain`. |
| `style` | `DEFAULT_STYLE` | Ramps and colours (`#rrggbb`), shared with `renderPopulationMap`. |

The overlay is one merged `BufferGeometry` per resolution (H3 cells differ in shape, so they aren't instances of one
hexagon), built into typed arrays with explicit bounds, plus one `LineSegments` for the networks. Geometry is stored
relative to the region centre so it stays precise on planets.
