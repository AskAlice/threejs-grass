# threejs-water

Oceans, lakes and rivers for three.js (WebGPU + TSL), from an ant on the beach to orbit. Works with a
[`threejs-biomes`](https://github.com/AskAlice/threejs-worldgen/tree/main/packages/biomes) world (flat or planet), and
on its own for a plain flat sea. Includes optional React Three Fiber components.

```bash
npm i threejs-water threejs-biomes three
```

- **`Ocean`**: one draw call at every altitude. A camera-centred grid of concentric rings (dense under the camera,
  sparse at the horizon, scaled with the camera's height) built in the local tangent plane and bent onto the planet in
  the vertex shader, clamped at the horizon. Gerstner waves with float64 phases (stable millions of metres from the
  origin), per-pixel wave normals that fade out before they alias, ripples, Fresnel sky or environment reflections, a
  GGX sun glint, refraction, depth-based absorption from shallow to deep colour, shoreline foam and whitecaps. Floating
  origin: everything is placed relative to `origin`.
- **`Rivers`**: river surfaces for the world's rivers, streamed in camera-centred tiles under a per-frame time budget.
  Flow follows the slope of the river surface; flow-mapped ripples and rapids foam move downstream.
- **Hydrology** for bounded maps (pure functions, no three.js): Priority-Flood+ε depression filling (Barnes et al.
  2014), D8 flow routing, flow accumulation, rivers by catchment area (widening downstream), lakes at their spill
  level, and `path` height modifiers that carve the rivers into the world. **`Lakes`** draws the result.
- **Queries** for gameplay and buoyancy: `ocean.waterAt(x, y, z)` (wavy surface, depth, normal), `waterAt(world, x, z)`
  (sea or river level, depth, flow) and `hydrologyWaterAt(result, x, z)`.

## three.js

```ts
import * as THREE from 'three/webgpu'
import { World } from 'threejs-biomes'
import { Ocean, Rivers, computeHydrology, riverModifiers, Lakes, waterAt } from 'threejs-water'

const renderer = new THREE.WebGPURenderer({ antialias: true })
await renderer.init()
const world = new World({ seed: 'coast' })
const sun = new THREE.DirectionalLight('#fff4e0', 3)

const ocean = await Ocean.create({ camera, scene, renderer, world, sun, waves: { amplitude: 0.8 } })
const rivers = await Rivers.create({ camera, scene, renderer, world, sun, maxDistance: 2000 })
// With `scene`, both update themselves whenever the scene renders.

ocean.set({ deepColor: '#06283a', whitecaps: 0.6, waves: { direction: [0, 1] } }) // live
ocean.setOrigin([x, y, z]) // floating origin, e.g. from threejs-biomes FloatingOrigin.onRebase

const { depth, normal } = ocean.waterAt(boat.position.x, boat.position.y, boat.position.z) // buoyancy
const here = waterAt(world, 120, -40) // { kind: 'river', level, depth, flowX, flowZ }

// Bounded map: real drainage, lakes and carved rivers.
const region = { x: -2000, z: -2000, width: 4000, depth: 4000, cellSize: 8 }
const hydrology = computeHydrology(world.height, region, { seaLevel: world.options.seaLevel, riverArea: 400_000 })
for (const m of riverModifiers(hydrology, world.frame)) world.addModifier(m)
const lakes = await Lakes.create({ hydrology, frame: world.frame, camera, scene, sun })
```

On a planet (`new World({ surface: 'sphere', radius: 120_000 })`) nothing changes: the ocean bends onto the sea
sphere and the rivers build in a tangent frame that re-centres on the camera as it travels.

## React Three Fiber

```tsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { WebGPURenderer } from 'three/webgpu'
import { Water, Ocean, Rivers, Lakes } from 'threejs-water/react'

<Canvas gl={async (props) => { const r = new WebGPURenderer(props as any); await r.init(); return r }}>
  <Water world={world} sun={sun} ocean={{ waves: { amplitude: 0.8 } }} rivers={{ maxDistance: 2000 }} />
  {/* or separately: */}
  <Ocean world={world} deepColor="#06283a" whitecaps={0.6} />
  <Rivers world={world} flowSpeed={1.4} />
  <Lakes hydrology={hydrology} frame={world.frame} />
</Canvas>
```

Props are the settings below. Every render calls `reset(props)`, so removing a prop reverts it. Use `ref` for the
underlying class (`OceanImpl`, `RiversImpl`, `LakesImpl` are re-exported).

## Settings

Every setting has a default and is live through `set(partial)` / `reset(full)`. All are plain JSON except `sun`,
`environment` (and the `world`, `camera`, `scene`, `renderer` constructor options).

### Appearance (`Ocean`, `Rivers`, `Lakes`)

| Setting | Default (ocean) | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `shallowColor` | `'#8fd8cf'` | Tint of light through shallow water. |
| `deepColor` | `'#0b3247'` | Colour where the bottom is out of sight. |
| `visibility` | `6` | Metres of water after which ~63% of the view through it is `deepColor`. |
| `refraction` | `0.035` | Screen-space refraction strength. |
| `roughness` | `0.06` | Blurs reflections and widens the glint; rises by itself with distance. |
| `reflectivity` | `0.02` | Fresnel reflectance looking straight down. |
| `skyColor`, `horizonColor` | `'#6e9fd6'`, `'#cfe0ee'` | Sky gradient reflected when there is no `environment`. |
| `environment` | `null` | Texture (equirect or cube) to reflect; prefiltered for you. |
| `environmentIntensity` | `1` | Multiplier on `environment`. |
| `specular` | `1` | Multiplier on the sun glint. |
| `sun` | `null` | `DirectionalLight` for glint and daylight; `null` = first one in the scene. |
| `foamColor` | `'#f3f7f8'` | Foam colour. |
| `foamWidth` | `0.6` | Depth (m) below which shoreline foam appears. |
| `foam` | `1` | Overall foam amount (shore, whitecaps, rapids). |
| `detail`, `detailScale`, `detailSpeed` | `0.25`, `1.4`, `0.4` | Ripple normal strength, wavelength (m), drift (m/s). |

### `Ocean`

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `waves.count` | `12` | Gerstner waves summed (≤ 16). |
| `waves.amplitude` | `0.45` | Amplitude of the longest wave, m; shorter waves keep its steepness. |
| `waves.wavelength` | `[0.6, 42]` | Shortest and longest wavelength, m. |
| `waves.direction` | `[1, 0.35]` | Wind direction [x, z] in the tangent plane. |
| `waves.spread` | `0.55` | 0 … 1 fan of wave directions around the wind. |
| `waves.choppiness` | `0.75` | 0 … 1 horizontal displacement (sharp crests); capped before crests fold. |
| `waves.speed` | `1` | Time multiplier. |
| `waves.seed` | `1` | Seed for wavelengths and directions. |
| `whitecaps` | `0.3` | Foam on the sharpest crests. |
| `origin` | `[0, 0, 0]` | World position at render-space (0, 0, 0). |
| `seaLevel`, `radius` | `0`, `0` | Used only without a `world` (radius 0 = flat). |
| `segments` | `128` | Vertices per ring: spacing ≈ distance × 2π / segments. |
| `range` | `1e7` | Outer ÷ inner ring radius (sets the ring count). |
| `innerRadius` | `0.01` | Smallest inner ring radius, m. |
| `altitudeFactor` | `0.02` | Inner ring radius as a fraction of the camera's height above the sea. |
| `reanchorDistance` | `10000` | Planets: metres travelled before the wave frame re-anchors (phases stay continuous). |

### `Rivers`

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `tileSize` | `128` | Tile edge, m. |
| `resolution` | `48` | Grid cells per tile side. |
| `maxDistance` | `1000` | Radius with rivers, m. Nothing is built while the camera is higher than this. |
| `buildBudget` | `4` | Milliseconds per frame for building tiles. |
| `expand` | `2` | Cells the surface extends past the water, to tuck under banks. |
| `surfaceOffset` | `0` | Raises or lowers the surface, m. |
| `minStrength` | `0.02` | World `river` strength where water starts. |
| `flowSpeed`, `minFlowSpeed`, `maxFlowSpeed` | `1`, `0.15`, `4` | Speed at a 1% slope (grows with √slope) and its limits, m/s. |
| `flowPeriod` | `2` | Seconds per flow-map cycle. |
| `rapids` | `2.5` | Speed (m/s) where rapids foam starts. |
| `reframeDistance` | `20000` | Planets: re-centre the tile frame on the camera after this many metres. |
| `origin` | `[0, 0, 0]` | Floating origin. |

River appearance defaults: `shallowColor '#a9cdb0'`, `deepColor '#1f3d33'`, `visibility 2.5`, `foamWidth 0.25`,
`detail 0.45`, `detailScale 0.9`.

### `Lakes`

Appearance, `origin`, `waves` (default calm: `amplitude 0.03`, `wavelength [0.3, 3]`), `whitecaps` (`0`), `expand`
(`1` cell), `rivers` (`true`: draw the hydrology rivers too), `flowSpeed`, `minFlowSpeed`, `maxFlowSpeed`,
`flowPeriod`, `rapids`.

### Hydrology (`computeHydrology(height, region, options)`)

`region` is `{ x, z, width, depth, cellSize }` (min corner and size in the frame, metres).

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `epsilon` | `1e-4` | Gradient (m per cell) put across filled flats so every cell drains. |
| `seaLevel` | `-Infinity` | Cells at or below are sea: outlets, never filled. |
| `riverArea` | `250000` | Catchment (m²) where a channel becomes a river. |
| `widthFactor`, `widthExponent` | `4`, `0.5` | Width = widthFactor × (area / 1 km²)^widthExponent. |
| `minWidth`, `maxWidth` | `1.5`, `120` | Width limits, m. |
| `depthFactor`, `minDepth` | `0.12`, `0.4` | Channel depth as a fraction of width, and its minimum. |
| `fill` | `0.75` | How full channels are. |
| `bankFalloff` | `1.5` | Bank slope width × channel half-width (the modifiers' falloff). |
| `minLakeArea`, `minLakeDepth` | `400`, `0.3` | Smallest lake kept (m², m). |
| `smoothing` | `2` | Smoothing passes over river polylines. |

The result has `filled`, `receivers`, `accumulation`, `lakeIndex` (per cell), `rivers` (polylines with surface, bed,
width and area per point) and `lakes` (level, area, max depth, cell mask). The steps are exported on their own too:
`sampleGrid`, `fillDepressions`, `flowReceivers`, `flowAccumulation`, `analyzeHydrology`, `riverModifiers`.
