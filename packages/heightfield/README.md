# threejs-heightfield

Ground under a three.js scene as a fast `(x, z) => y` lookup. Bake any mesh or group into a heightfield once, then
sample heights, measure slope and ray-march it without per-object raycasts. It's the base layer that
[`threejs-grass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/threejs-grass) and the other
[threejs-worldgen](https://github.com/AskAlice/threejs-worldgen) packages use to put things on terrain.

```bash
npm i threejs-heightfield three
```

```ts
import { bakeHeightfield, createHeightSampler, raycastHeight, slopeAt } from 'threejs-heightfield'

const height = bakeHeightfield(terrainMesh)        // any Object3D; world transforms included
height(12, -40)                                      // terrain height there, NaN off the terrain
slopeAt(height, 12, -40)                             // rise / run, e.g. to keep trees off cliffs
raycastHeight(height, camera.position, rayDir)      // Vector3 hit point or null, e.g. for brushes

const flat = createHeightSampler()                   // no terrain: y = 0 everywhere
const hills = createHeightSampler((x, z) => Math.sin(x * 0.03) * 4) // functions pass straight through
```

| Export | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bakeHeightfield(root, maxResolution = 1024)` | Rasterises every mesh under `root` on the CPU into a bilinear height lookup. Where surfaces overlap, the highest wins. |
| `createHeightSampler(terrain?, maxResolution?)` | Accepts a mesh, a height function or nothing, and returns a `HeightFn`. |
| `slopeAt(sample, x, z, e = 0.25)` | Gradient magnitude by central differences. |
| `raycastHeight(sample, origin, dir, maxDistance = 2000, step = 0.5)` | Ray-march then bisect against any `HeightFn`. |
| `type HeightFn` / `type Terrain` | `(x, z) => number` / `Object3D \| HeightFn` |
