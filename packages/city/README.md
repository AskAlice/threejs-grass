# threejs-city

Procedural settlements for three.js on [`threejs-biomes`](https://github.com/AskAlice/threejs-worldgen/tree/main/packages/biomes)
worlds: hamlets to cities placed where the land suits them, road networks grown along a tensor field, blocks and lots,
buildings matched to the local climate, procedural TSL facades and road surfaces with weather hooks, and terrain flattened
under it all. Works on flat worlds and on planets, from orbit down to street level. Everything derives from `seed` and the
world, and every setting is live.

```bash
npm i threejs-city threejs-biomes three
```

## three.js

```ts
import { WebGPURenderer } from 'three/webgpu'
import { World } from 'threejs-biomes'
import { City, findSettlements } from 'threejs-city'

const world = new World({ seed: 11 })
const [site] = findSettlements(world, world.frame, { minX: -5000, minZ: -5000, maxX: 5000, maxZ: 5000 })
const city = await City.create({ world, camera, scene, center: [site.x, site.z], size: site.size, radius: site.radius })
// That's it: it updates itself (LOD, progressive generation) whenever `scene` renders.

city.set({ facade: { night: 1 } })                       // lights on (a uniform: free)
city.set({ weather: { roofs: { snow: 1 } } })            // snow on every roof
city.setBuildingWeather(42, { burn: 0.9 })               // one building on fire
city.set({ style: 'organic', seed: 2 })                  // layout settings regenerate
city.buildingAt(x, z)                                    // Building | null (frame-local x, z)
city.graph?.shortestPath(a, b)                           // node ids along the roads
city.dispose()                                           // also removes its terrain edits
```

Every settlement in a region at once, sized by how good each site is:

```ts
import { Settlements } from 'threejs-city'
const towns = await Settlements.create({ world, camera, scene, region: { minX: -20000, minZ: -20000, maxX: 20000, maxZ: 20000 } })
```

On a planet, pass a frame: `City.create({ world, frame: world.frameAt(lat, lon), … })`. The city's root object is placed
and oriented on the sphere, and its flatten modifiers are converted to planet coordinates, so roads and buildings sit
exactly on the terrain.

Needs `WebGPURenderer` from `three/webgpu` (it falls back to WebGL2 by itself).

## React Three Fiber

```tsx
import { City, Settlements } from 'threejs-city/react'

<City world={world} size="village" center={[200, -50]} facade={{ night }} weather={{ roads: { wetness: rain } }} />
<Settlements world={world} region={{ minX: -8000, minZ: -8000, maxX: 8000, maxZ: 8000 }} city={{ facade: { night } }} />
```

Props are the options (`reset(props)` on every render, `update()` in `useFrame`). `ref` gives the `CityImpl` /
`SettlementsImpl` instance. `react` and `@react-three/fiber` are optional peer dependencies; the core never imports them.

## How it works

1. **Placement** (`findSettlements`): the frame is cut into `cellSize` squares, each sampled on a grid. A site scores
   flatness × nearness to a river or coast (but dry) × temperate climate × not in an excluded biome. The best site per
   square above `threshold` becomes a settlement, sized by *importance* (score × room to grow × a seeded prosperity
   roll), so hamlets are common and cities rare.
2. **Roads** (`growRoads`): arterials grow from the centre and branch into collectors and local streets
   (Parish & Müller 2001), following a tensor field (Chen et al. 2008) built from grid patches, a radial centre and the
   terrain gradient (streets along contours and coasts). Local constraints: avoid water and steep grades (steer, else
   prune), snap to nearby junctions and roads, refuse acute angles, bridge narrow rivers. The result is a planar
   `RoadGraph` (crossings are always nodes). Surfaces follow class, district and size: asphalt, cobbled old-town
   streets, gravel and dirt farm tracks; rural roads have no kerbs.
3. **Blocks and lots**: faces of the graph (half-edge traversal), inset by each road's half width and sidewalk, split by
   recursive oriented-bounding-box cuts that keep street frontage. Roads through open ground get lots along both sides
   (villages, ribbon development, farmsteads).
4. **Districts**: downtown, residential, industrial, park and farmland, by distance from the centre plus noise.
5. **Buildings**: towers (podium, shaft and crown, with box, chamfered, round or inset shafts), apartment blocks
   (penthouses, balconies), houses (gable, hip, skillion or flat roofs, L-shaped wings, chimneys, stilts) and sheds
   (saw-tooth roofs). Materials, roofs and details come from an architecture picked from the climate at the centre:
   `temperate`, `cold` (steep roofs, timber), `arid` (adobe, flat roofs), `mediterranean`, `tropical`, `wetland` (stilts).
6. **Terrain**: each road gets a graded profile (max grade, smoothed); `FlattenPath` modifiers along the roads (bridges
   excluded) and pads under buildings are registered on the world in one batch and removed on `dispose()`.

### Rendering

- Walls and roofs: one `BatchedMesh` each, with a full and a box geometry per building; LOD swaps geometry per
  instance (`setGeometryIdAt`) and hides far buildings.
- Balconies, railings, rooftop plant, tanks, antennas, chimneys, AC units and stilts: one more `BatchedMesh` of eight
  shared unit geometries, instanced with per-instance matrices and colour.
- Roads: one indexed mesh of shared-vertex strips (carriageway, kerbs, sidewalks, skirts, bridge decks, parapets, piers)
  and junction discs.
- Geometry is built straight into typed arrays (16-bit indices where they fit), bounds are set explicitly, and all
  materials are shared TSL node materials varied per vertex or instance.

Facades are a TSL shader: per-style window grids from wall coordinates (metres along the wall and above the ground
floor), frames and mullions, shopfronts, window lights hashed per window that glow with `night`, and procedural
plaster, brick, wood, stone, concrete, glass, adobe and metal. Roofs draw tiles, slates, shingles, standing-seam metal,
thatch and gravel. Roads draw lane markings, worn tyre tracks, cracks and patches on asphalt, cobblestones, gravel,
rutted dirt, paving slabs and kerbs. No texture assets.

### Weather hooks

`weather.walls`, `weather.roofs` and `weather.roads` each take `{ wetness, snow, burn, damage }` (0..1, default 0);
`city.setBuildingWeather(id, partial)` overrides single buildings (the larger value wins). Wet surfaces darken and turn
glossy, with puddles on roads; snow settles on upward faces and stays out of tyre tracks; burn chars surfaces with
embers near 1; damage adds cracks, holes and potholes. They are uniforms and a small data texture, so a weather system
can drive them every frame.

### Data for other packages

`city.data()` returns a JSON-safe `CityData` in frame-local metres: road nodes and edges (class, surface, width,
sidewalk, lanes, speed, access, graded centreline), lots (district, polygon, street frontage and its road edge) and
buildings (style, material, roof, height, footprint, entrance). Add props to `city.local`, which uses the same
coordinates.

```ts
import { laneOffset, pointOnEdge, roadAnchors, routeCost } from 'threejs-city'
const data = city.data()!
roadAnchors(data, { spacing: 30, surfaces: ['asphalt'] })          // street lights
roadAnchors(data, { spacing: 45, sides: 'one', types: ['secondary'] }) // power poles
data.lots.filter((l) => l.frontage && l.building >= 0)            // mailboxes at l.frontage
const route = city.graph!.shortestPath(from, to, routeCost('bicycle', city.options.roads))
const edge = data.roads.edges[e]
pointOnEdge(edge, t, laneOffset(edge, 0, 1))                      // a car in the first lane, a→b
```

## Options

All optional; every field has a default (`DEFAULT_CITY`). Nested objects merge field by field. Layout changes
regenerate the settlement, palette changes rebuild its meshes, everything else is a uniform.

Object inputs (not options): `world`, `frame`, `camera`, `scene`.

Placement (`findSettlements(world, frame, region, options)`): `seed`, `cellSize` (5000), `sampleSpacing` (250),
`threshold`, `margin`, `maxSlope`, `water`, `temperature` ± `temperatureRange`, `moisture` ± `moistureRange`,
`minElevation`, `excludeBiomes`, `variety`, `room`, `sizes`.

The pipeline is exported piece by piece and is pure (no DOM, no GPU): `planCity`, `growRoads`, `extractBlocks`,
`subdivideBlock`, `roadsideLots`, `planBuilding`, `gradeRoads`, `buildingGeometry`, `roadGeometry`, `cityData`.

## Performance

A town (radius ~600 m, ~200–300 buildings) plans in about 0.1 s plus terrain sampling (a few hundred ms of world
noise); a 1.5 km city (~3,600 buildings, ~6,000 road edges) in under a second plus mesh building. Use
`progressive: true` for big cities. The world checks every modifier's bounding box per height sample, so thousands of
pads cost terrain time; set `terrain.flattenLots: false` for very large cities.
